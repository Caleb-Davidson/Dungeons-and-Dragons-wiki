# Jamenkin Whitford d'Cannith
Viscount Whitford d'Canntith as he preferred to be called, made a name for his family during the last war. A group of highly skilled mercenaries had holed up in the mountainous border between Korvhall and ____. Using guerilla tactics the mercenaries had managed to win several major fights, even pulling a win over a sizeable Deneith force. However Whitford was able to force a surrender using some of house Cannith's prototype warforged, a siege tank style machine that was capable of moving on it's own. This fight along with some minor victories that secured him some land established the Whitfords as a notable name within House Cannith. The living leader of the Whitford family today is Astrid Whitford d'Cannith, Marquess.
