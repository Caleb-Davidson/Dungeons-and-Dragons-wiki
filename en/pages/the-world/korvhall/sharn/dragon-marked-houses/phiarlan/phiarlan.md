## House Phiarlan
House Phiarlan is a house known throughout Antiga, although they are now based in Sharn, due to their former base of operation in Cyre having been destroyed in the Day of Mourning. To the public Phiarlan is a house of entertainment comprised of bards, actors, artists and acrobats though, in secret it is a house of spies.
House Phiarlan contains both the Entertainers Guild and the Artisans Guild, but they also secretly run the Serpentine Table and the Carnival of Shadows. During the Shadow Schism, a portion of House Phiarlan splintered off to form House Thuranni. House Phiarlan's original headquarters was destroyed in Cyre, and they have not created a new headquarters, preferring to stick to the shadows.

## History
House Phiarlan was one of the first Dragonmarked Houses to be formed. The first members of House Phiarlan were scouts and bards who raised morale and brought news and information to the scattered elven tribes. The Phiarlans traveled between settlements as troubadours and mediators. Over time the Phiarlans mastered the art of trading information and made sure to use the information they had to their advantage.

At the dawn of the Current Age, around -3200 the first dragonmarks appeared, including the Mark of Shadow. During this time the dragons were already at war with the elves and the dragonmarked garnered the suspicion of the dragons. When it was revealed that House Vol was in an alliance with dragons, the War of the Mark began in an attempt to exterminate the House. The elves who carried the Mark of Shadow knew it to be unsafe for the dragonmarked so they fled to Korvhall in an effort to avoid the same fate as House Vol and upon arriving they banded together to form House Phiarlan around -2600. The House's artistic skills earned them a place within the five nations and in time the Serpentine Table offered its expertise to those in power there.

#### The Last War
During the Last War, House Phiarlan offered its services of spying and intelligence to all nations, refusing to side with anyone. Due to House Phiarlan's secrecy and to the fact that they were taking contracts from all sides, eventually House Phiarlan agents found themselves contracted against each other which led to conflicting loyalties. The result was a cataclysmic event for Phiarlan named the Shadow Schism which tore the House apart and led to the creation of Phiarlan's rivals, House Thuranni who themselves, are former members of Phiarlan.

## Iconography
House Phiarlan uses two symbols, the heraldic mark of the hydra and the mask of shadows. The mark of the hydra is the house's primrary symbol and features a five headed hydra along with a blade resting below it. Four of the heads are aggresive looking whilst one is more tame and calm. The symbol represents the artistic divisions within the house and resilience. The less popular symbol, the mask of shadows, is usually worn by members as either literal full sized masks or more subtle badges or jewellery. The mask of shadows is silver in colour and has a stylized design.
