## House Tharashk
House Tharashk has recently begun spreading throughout Korvhall, though it is still heavily based in the Shadow Marches. The house is the second youngest of the Dragonmarked houses. Its members are renowned prospectors, bounty hunters, and inquisitives. Tharashk is the only house to hire monstrous laborers and mercenaries from Droaam, with whom they have an alliance.

## Dragonmark
House Tharashk possesses the Mark of Finding. This mark grants various magical benefits related to locating people and objects which in turn has led to their fame for bounty hunting.

## History
Around 1000 years ago, the Mark of Finding made its first appearance on members of three Shadow Marches clans: the Torrns, the Velderans, and the Aashtas. Word of master huntsmen from the Shadow Marches who possessed an unknown dragonmark soon spread throughout Korvhall. In the late 600s YK, a group of House Sivis gnomes decided to go in search of this dragonmark and upon discovering the three clans they helped them form House Tharashk.

Though new to the civilized world of the Five Nations and the rest of Antiga, Tharashk found its purpose relatively fast and adapted well. However, being master hunters wasn't enough to survive in this new world so upon learning of the high demand and value of dragonshards, Tharashk decided to compete in trade and business. The dragonshard trade not only helped Tharashk earn its place in Korvhall but created its wealth and influence. Despite this, there are many who distrust House Tharashk, calling them "graybloods".

## Hierarchy
House Tharashk is governed the Triumvirate, a council of only three members. Each is a representative from the three major clans. The current three triumvirs are Daric d'Velderan, Khundar'aashta, and Maagrim Torrn d'Tharashk.

## Tharashk Clans
Unlike other dragonmarked houses, Tharashk's clans are incredibly important and they are not as united as their peers. It is uncommon for a Tharashk house member to refer to themselves as "d'Tharashk" and the use of their clan name is more prominent. The three main clans are Aashta, Torrn and Velderan, though these aren't the only clans that make up Tharashk, smaller clans tend to be aligned with one of them. Although the clans do their best to work together for the sake of the house, heirs often put the interests of their clan before the house, which has led to many feuds.

## Membership
Family ties are important to those in House Tharashk, so the only way to become a member is through marriage. Though the house is a union of orc and Shadow Marches human cultures, the house accepts anyone regardless of race, so long as they share their values. The house also takes in those who have no dragonmark and use them in the mercantile fields. Heirs of House Tharashk live hard lives and are encouraged to practice a wide range of skills. Experts, rangers, and rogues are most common throughout the house, though Tharashk has a use for most classes such as fighters, scouts, and barbarians. Even aristocrats can be found serving as mediators for mercenary contracts in the cities. The house doesn't attract many wizards or artificers, although a tradition of sorcery runs through the clans. There are rumors of warlocks within the Aashta clan who are followers of the Dragon Below. Druids who follow the Gatekeepers work for the house by working alongside prospectors to protect and restore the land.

While all members of House Tharashk are humans and half-orcs, not all members carry the Mark of Finding. All blood heirs of House Tharashk are entitled to use d'Tharashk as a surname, or to add the d' prefix to their clan name

## Business
House Tharashk act as a proxy business for the Daughters of Sora Kell by negotiating trade with the rest of Korvhall for them. Anyone wanting to contract the monster laborers or mercenaries of Droaam must go through Tharashk. House Deneith are in direct competition with Tharashk as they wish to wrestle the monster mercenaries out of their control. Though neither house admits to open conflict with each other, sabotage and secret operations occur often. House Tharashk makes a large amount of profit through prospecting and the sale of dragonshards. Additionally, many House Tharashk heirs become professional inquisitives and can be hired.

## Droaam Contracts
House Tharashk contracts monster races from Droaam to either be mercenaries or laborers. Contracted monsters are first evaluated to make sure they are able to communicate and be nonviolent towards other humanoids. They are then licensed and monitored by the Dragonne's Roar. Gnolls, ogres, and minotaurs are fielded as mercenaries or laborers, while gargoyles and harpies are used as couriers, scouts, and messengers. As a rule, House Tharashk only contracts monsters to clients with good credentials such as dragonmarked heirs. Mercenaries are more expensive than laborers as laborers will only fight when their own life is threatened. Services are restricted to one location such as a city, contracted monsters cannot be taken on journeys. The house makes profit through volume so monsters are often contracted in groups larger than twenty and for at least a month's work paid in advance.

## Relations
Overall the people of Korvhall feel indifferent to members of House Tharashk, though many believe them to be provincial and uncivilized. Many find the presence of contracted monsters unsettling, especially outside large communities.
