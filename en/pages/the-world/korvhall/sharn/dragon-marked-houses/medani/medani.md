## House Medani
House Medani is known as the smallest and one of the youngest houses. However, despite its size and age, its members are seemingly everywhere, working as operatives in various fields such as guards, researchers, advisers, inquisitives and spy-catchers. Unlike most dragonmarked houses, Medani has a strong geographical presence and has presence among all 5 nations of Antiga.

## Dragonmark
House Medani possesses the Mark of Detection. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to detect threats making Medani sentries an invaluable asset to nobles and royal families across Antiga.

## History
The Mark of Detection first appeared around the year -1500 on the half-elves of Breland. The Medani were so secretive with their dragonmark that when House Cannith first discovered them during the War of the Mark, they mistook them as possessing aberrant marks. Medani had little aspiration beyond the borders of Breland so when the other houses requested they join them as an official dragonmarked house, Medani refused. The dragonmarked houses were adamant on their membership and so through much negotiation and some veiled threats, Medani reluctantly joined. Even after joining the dragonmarked houses, Medani showed little interest with the other houses and rarely got involved with the politics of them. Through their lack of participation, Medani has earned itself a reputation for being distant, secretive and for being concerned only for themselves. House Medani is now seen as the black sheep of the dragonmarked houses and many have become concerned with their close relationship with the Brelish crown. This perception of the house flourishes to the present day and the suspicion of the other houses has only grown as Medani has captured countless spies who attempted to infiltrate the house in search of their well guarded secrets, many of the spies were House Phiarlan and House Thuranni members.

#### The Last War
The rumors of Medani having allegiance to Breland over the other houses became evermore solid during the Last War as Medani worked for the crown as a counter-intelligence arm, discovering and apprehending spies and assassins from rival nations. Despite its blatant preference towards Breland, Medani never went as far as to directly supply infiltration services. However, due to the war there was a shortage of law enforcers in the country, so Medani participated in a lot of criminal investigations. The connection between Medani and Breland remains to the present day and now the house has a subtle yet broad influence over the ruling of the nation.

## Business
Like all dragonmarked Medani trades with the nations of Antiga however, they favour trade with Breland so much to the point they have directly supplied operatives to work within King Boranel's court. House Medani additionally uncovered the murder of Bornanel's first wife Queen Chaseva.

The Warning Guild provides bodyguards, inquisitives and sentries for hire all across Khorvaire. Despite taking part in the guarding business, there is little conflict between Deneith and Medani as Medani's fewer numbers of members causes little competition. A common belief when hiring bodyguards is that you hire Deneith when you expect to get attacked and hire Medani guards when you believe someone is plotting against you though you're unsure who it is or their motive.

The Basilisk's Gaze guild hunts war criminals wanted by the five nations. Despite its reclusive nature towards the other dragonmarked houses, Medani is an active member of the Twelve.
