## Dragonmark
House Orien possesses the Mark of Passage. This mark grants various magical benefits that allow its bearers to control travel and teleportation.

## History
The Mark of Passage first appeared in Aundair around the year -1900. Most of the humans who developed the mark were experienced travelers and teamsters who soon formed a group when learning of their common bond. During these early years, the marked humans competed against each other however, they soon united when they realized what they could accomplish together. The newly established House Orien immediately began putting their efforts into the caravan business, delivering goods across Korvhall. During these times the roads were quite dangerous so Orien set out to secure safe passage for their vehicles by exercising their diplomatic powers and pure magical ability. As the house prospered, Orien invested in the development of new roads and upgrading the old ones. In the days before the Sivis speaking stone network, House Orien ran a post system that was used across the Five Nations.

In 811 YK the first lightning rail was constructed by House Cannith and the elemental binders of Zilargo. This technology revolutionized transportation and so it was only a matter of time before Orien involved itself with the business. Orien began to manage the lighting rail and soon was in control of where the lightning rails spread as Orien commissioned for a group to be formed known as the Trailblazers, whose objective is to explore new routes for the rail to travel and lay the conductor stones for the rail to follow.

#### The Last War
The war adversely effected House Orien as bridges and rail tracks were often destroyed in order to slow down enemy advancements. To make matters worse, House Lyrandar has began running the airship business in recent years. House Orien's dominance over the field of transportation has never been so unsure, in an effort to regain control the house has begun to focus on its teleportation business though, teleportation remains expensive.

## Business
House Orien has a large stake in the transportation business and a dominance over the postal business. It separates these two businesses into two guilds, the couriers guild and the transportation guild. The couriers guild hires independent messengers and couriers to deliver letters and small parcels, whilst the transportation guild prepares goods for shipment, running the lightning rail and maintaining the trade roads. The transportation guild is the largest dragonmarked guild and has tens of thousands of employees.

It is rare for one to hire an Orien caravan to travel to a location of their choice as the price is often too steep. It is far more common to find travelers paying a fee in order to accompany a caravan along its set route throughout a city or to a nearby settlement. House Orien often waves the fare for adventurers so long as they offer their services to protect the caravan. The house also runs a teleportation business, though due to its high fees it has yet to become a mainstream form of transportation.
