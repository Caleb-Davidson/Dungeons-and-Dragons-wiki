Noble titles can be hereditary, meaning they're passed down, or they can last only for the person's lifetime. Life titles, as they're called, are usually honorary.

No one today is made a hereditary peer who did not inherit it from a relative.

## Emperor, Empress
A military title. Soldiers would salute the leader of a victorious army as "imperator." The title Emperor is officially given to the person who is the absolute military leader over all of Korvhall. Because of the house system and their inherit distrust of each other, there have only been a few Emperors throughout history. Most military conflicts being handled by the Kingdom's standing military, or with formal treaties drawn between the Kingdom and the Houses.

## King, Queen
The monarch outranks everyone else. A monarch inherits their title from the previous king or queen. England historically gave preference to male rulers, but the Queen still outranks her husband since she inherited the title. Queen Elizabeth II is married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; having married into the royal family, he is known as Prince Consort, rather than king. A woman who marries a king would be known as queen consort (as opposed to a queen regnant, or a ruling queen). A monarch is generally addressed with the phrase "Your Majesty".

Commoners who marry into a royal family, such as Antony Armstrong-Jones who married Princess Margaret, typically receive a courtesy title. A courtesy title has no legal importance. It is not necessarily a hereditary title. Armstrong-Jones was made the Earl of Snowdon.

## Prince, Princess
In England, a prince or princess are often children of the monarch, and therefore royalty, as opposed to nobility. But, those holding the title can vary in rank. In France, a duke, or "duc" outranks a prince. In Russia and Austria, the title archduke is an indication of royal blood, and is used instead of prince.  In the UK, the eldest son of the monarch is given the title Prince of Wales, as is currently held by Prince Charles. A prince or princess would typically be referred to as "your royal highness."

## Duke, Duchess
A duke, from the Latin dux (another word for a military leader), is the ruler of a dukedom or duchy. If the dukedom is an independent country, its leader may be called a grand duke. Originally all English dukes were of royal blood. When sons of kings came of age they were typically given the title duke. Now a duke is the highest rank of English nobility. Ducal status is conferred by marriage, as in the case of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, or Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. A prince, as such, is typically a prince and a duke; Prince William and Prince Harry are Princes of the UK, while also being called the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex respectively. A duke would typically be addressed as "your grace," as would an archbishop.

## Other Noble Titles
Three titles hold a pretty similar stature, although they are somewhat different. An earl is at the head of a county. In most European countries this title is instead known as a count. Earl comes from an old English word, eorl, which had a similar meaning. A marquess is effectively the earl of an important border county (also known as a march). Since securing the border was such an important job, the rank of marquess is often considered superior to earl or count. The term margrave has a basically identical meaning, from the German "markgraf," as opposed to the French "marquis".

That leaves the two lowest ranks of the peerage, viscount, and baron. A viscount (from the phrase vice-count) is immediately below an earl. They were originally administrators and judges who ruled over specific regions of a county, hence the name.

A baron is the lowest level. Barons were the basic building block of feudal land ownership; holding land in barony meant that they acted on the king's behalf to own a chunk of land. Barons are not actually called barons, but are rather called Lord or Lady.

A baronet is not included among the peerage, but the title can be inherited. Below a baronet, is a knight, which is a title of honor rather aristocracy.
